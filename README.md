# EarlyBird
# Description
Early Bird is a website that offers financial services to target young investors who have short or
mid-term investment horizons with AUM less than 50K and are willing to actively manage their
own portfolio. Users are going to complete a preliminary questionnaire regarding their
investment goal and risk tolerance level. If users are considered qualified, they can initiate a
financial plan on the website. They can sign up either by email or their social media accounts.
Each user has a dashboard with 4 main sections: Current AUM amount, Current investment
combination (user’s choice), Mock investment combination (our recommendations), and Market
Trend News.

# Motivation
The rise of Robinhood fundamentally changed the financial services industry. By 2014, the
cheapest online brokers were still charging $5 to $8 a trade. Robinhood pushed trading costs to
its theoretical limit: Zero. With a sleek, easy to navigate the mobile app, it’s not surprising that
Robinhood is popular among millennials.
We expect that accessing the financial market with zero cost will attract more beginning and
younger investors. As a result, we decided to develop a website where people can initiate their
financial plans to achieve their short or mid-term investment goals. Users will create their own
profiles on the Early Bird website by answering questions on investment goal, income, asset,
risk assessment and will engage with the app at various times but will receive daily updates on
changes to recommendations.
